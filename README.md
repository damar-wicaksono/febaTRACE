2. ``R``: R code to analyze output
3. ``data``: contains experimental data as is.
4. ``reports``: reports either TM, paper, or journal article
5. ``python``: python code to pre-process, run, and post-process
6. ``figures``: figures produced either for exploratory or publication purposes
7. ``misc``: miscellaneous files, probably programs used to carry out the analysis
8. ``output``: all produced data, either analytic data or computational results
