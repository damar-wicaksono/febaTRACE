An overview of what each of these:

1. ``data``: contains experimental data as is.
2. ``figures``: figures produced either for exploratory or publication purposes
3. ``misc``: misc. files, probably programs used to carry out the analysis
4. ``output``: all produced data, either analytic data or computational results
5. ``python``: python code to pre-process, run, and post-process
6. ``R``: R code to analyze output
7. ``reports``: reports either TM, paper, or journal article with their references
8. ``TRACE``: TRACE FEBA model for all test runs
